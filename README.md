# HelloWorld
My First Repository

Hi

This is my first go at Git-Hub. I am an old school developer from th mid 90's who made a carreer out of ERP systems implitations and who now wants to break the mold and join you young folk making Web Sites and stuff.

Apperently Version control is a bit of an issue and Git Hub helps with that and collaboration. It's a brave new world for me, let's see if the old dog can learn new tricks.

:-)
